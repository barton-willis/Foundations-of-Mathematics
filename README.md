# Foundations-of-Mathematics

Here you will find some course materials for my Spring 2023 course MATH 250 (Foundations of Mathematics) at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. 
This course covers sets, functions, and logic. And we'll learn the basic proof techniques. Along the way, we'll learn to use LaTeX.

Our textbook is _Introduction to Mathematical Structures and Proofs_ (second edition) by Larry Gerstein.
